# Privacy Policy for SelectR

**Last updated:** December 6, 2024

## Overview

SelectR is a browser extension that helps developers test XPath and CSS selectors on web pages. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our practices.

## Data Collection

**SelectR does not collect, transmit, or share any personal data.**

### What we store locally

The extension stores the following data **locally on your device** using Chrome's `storage.local` API:

- Your last used selector query
- Your selected mode (XPath or CSS)

This data never leaves your browser and is only used to restore your session when you reopen the extension.

### What we do NOT collect

- Personal information
- Browsing history
- Website content
- Analytics or usage data
- Cookies or tracking identifiers

## Permissions Explained

| Permission | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `activeTab` | Access the current tab to evaluate selectors when you click the extension |
| `scripting` | Inject the content script that highlights matched elements |
| `storage` | Save your query locally so it persists between sessions |
| `sidePanel` | Display the extension UI in Chrome's side panel |
| `Host permissions` | Run on any website where you need to test selectors |

## Third-Party Services

SelectR does not use any third-party services, analytics, or external APIs.

## Data Security

All data remains on your local device. We have no servers and no way to access your information.

## Changes to This Policy

If we make changes to this privacy policy, we will update the "Last updated" date above.
